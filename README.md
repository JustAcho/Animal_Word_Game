# Animal_Word_Game

Implementation for a simple "prediction" style game. The game needs to "guess" what animal are you thinking about.

There is a save system implemented. This means that after every game, if you chose to do so, you can save the game to the data base.
This will make the systems library of animals bigger -> the chance for a correct prediction will be higher.

To start the game, you need to interpred TheAnimalWordGame.hs file and then call the "main" function. This will show you the menu of the game.

This project was made as a part of my Functional Programming course in the Faculty of Mathematics and Informatics.
